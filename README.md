# Code Refactor Starter Code
**On-the-job ticket** Starter code provided for refactoring.

## Description

The website for Horiseon Social Solution Services Inc is a live website. My services for refactoring the website was sought to help improve the code to meet Accessibility standards. 

It was important for Horiseon the code meets Accessibility standards to be more inclusive with their marketing. It helps to avoid possible litigation from certain groups that determine the website is not accesssible to everyone.

I learned that providing simple semantic for Style.css and HTML will help those who need assistance with using screen readers, video captions, and other types to acces the website. It was important to double-check and ensure that links are working properly on the website. Links nont working properly on a website will cause confusion and frustration for the user.
